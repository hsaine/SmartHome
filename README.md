<h1 align="center">Abstract</h1>
The concept of a smart home, in which various appliances and systems can be controlled
and monitored remotely, has become increasingly popular in recent years. One popular method
for implementing a smart home is to use an Arduino microcontroller. The Arduino is a small,
affordable, and easy-to-use microcontroller that can be programmed to control and interact with
a variety of sensors and actuators.
In this projet, we present a smart home system that uses an Arduino Mega microcontroller to
control and monitor various appliances and systems. The system includes temperature and light
sensors, which are used to adjust the temperature and lighting in the home, as well as motion
sensors, which are used to detect movement and trigger alarms. Additionally, we also explore
the use of actuators, such as LED lights and motors, to control various aspects of the home,
such as opening and closing blinds.
The system is designed to be easy to use and requires minimal programming knowledge.
The code for the system is open-source and can be easily modified to suit the needs of the user.
The system is also designed to be expandable, meaning that additional sensors and actuators can
be added as needed. Overall, this projet demonstrates the feasibility of using an Arduino Mega
microcontroller to control and monitor various appliances and systems in a smart home. The
system is easy to use, affordable, and expandable, making it a suitable option for those looking
to implement a smart home.
